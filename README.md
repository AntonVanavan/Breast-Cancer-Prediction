# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
-This project is about the prediction of breast cancer using various Machine Learning algorithms. 
-We take the wisconsin breast cancer prediction dataset and do the analysis and visualization using python libraries like pandas, seaborn etc.
-Then we split the data into train and test and use various Machine learning models for prediction.
-The result is visually represented in a web dashboard using Streamlit
