# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This project is about the prediction of breast cancer using various Machine Learning algorithms. We take the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and do the analysis and visualization using python libraries like pandas, seaborn etc. Then we split the data into train and test data and use various machine learning models for prediction. The result is visually represented in a web dashboard using Streamlit
